We import the pandas library and the random module.
We replace the line that generates random numbers with a line that uses the sample method of a pandas Series object to generate the next numbers. The sample method takes three arguments:
n: The number of samples to draw.
weights: The probability weights associated with each element of the series. In this case, we use the prob list that we calculated earlier.
replace: Whether to sample with replacement. We set this to False to ensure that we donâ€™t get duplicate numbers.
We convert the resulting series of numbers back to a list of strings and join them together with hyphens.
